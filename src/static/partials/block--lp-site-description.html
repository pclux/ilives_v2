    <h2>Preserving PEI's community histories</h2>
    <p class="lp-site-description">
        Made possible through a generous private donation, IslandLives contains
        community and church histories and it builds on the Robertson Libraryâ€™s
        mission to preserve and share unique material relating to Prince Edward
        Island and demonstrates UPEI's ongoing commitment to making PEI's
        cultural and published heritage available to all. Welcome.
